Objective
Today, we're learning and practicing an algorithmic concept called Recursion. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial
factorial (N) = 1                           N<=1
                N * factorial (N-1)         otherwise

Task
Write a factorial function that takes a positive integer, N as a parameter and prints the result of N!(N factorial).

Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of 0.

Input Format

A single integer, N(the argument to pass to factorial).

Constraints
2<=N<=12
Your submission must contain a recursive function named factorial.

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting N!.

Sample Input

3

Sample Output

6

Explanation

Consider the following steps:
factorial(3) = 3 * factorial (2)
factorial(2) = 2 * factorial (1)
factorial(1) = 1

From steps 2 and 3, we can say factorial(2)=2*1=2; then when we apply the value from factorial(2)to step 1, we get factorial(3)=3*2*1=6. Thus, we print 6 as our answer.

def factorial(n):
    if n<=1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)


n=int(input().strip())
