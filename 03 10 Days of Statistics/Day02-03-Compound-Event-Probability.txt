Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event. We recommend you review today's Probability Tutorial before attempting this challenge.

Task
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.

    Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
    Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
    Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4
